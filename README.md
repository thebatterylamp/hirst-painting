# hirst-painting

Damien Hirst is a famous Artist. He is popular for using unique colors and creating patterns of simple DOTs. 
One of his DOT paintings was sold for over a Million USD. 
So I recreated one of his paintings using his color palette using the Python Turtle Package. 
I hope you enjoy playing around with it.
